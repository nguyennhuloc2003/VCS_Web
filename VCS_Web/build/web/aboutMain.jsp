                    <h2>About Corona Virus </h2>
                    <p>As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread 
                        through droplets and virus particles released into the air 
                        when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes.
                        Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious 
                        particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially 
                        where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why 
                        mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.
                    </p>
